This is the outline of the report to be written

Part I: Introduction

1. Motivations
- Cloud computing
- Xen hypervisor
- IP stack not efficient

2. Related work
- XenSocket
- XWay
- XenLoop
- User friendly but sub-optimal

3. Our work
- Memory mapping in userspace
- Less syscalls
- Report outline


Part II: Shared memory device

1. Xen shared memory
- Grant table - grant references
- Granting and mapping


2. Initialization( via ioctls )
- Different states
- Ioctl to move from one state to another


3. Map memory into user-space 

4. Event channel related operations
- Ports and event handling
- Init signal/User signal

5. Closure and broken pipe detection
- State on shared page
- Wait queue to free on offerer's side

Part III: Shared memory based circular buffer

1. Principles
- Read/write in circular buffer
- Wait when nothing can be done
- Exchange protocol

2. Optimizations
- 64b copy if possible
- Active/passive mod

3. Closure and dead-lock avoidance
- Flags system
- Epipe prone system

Part IV: Evaluation

1. Throughput
- Vary shared memory size and packet size
- Comparison with other solutions and IP stack

2. Delays
- Ping measure
- High frequency pings ?
- Comparison with other solutions and IP stack

3. Putting the cache under more pressure
- Multiple parallel communications
